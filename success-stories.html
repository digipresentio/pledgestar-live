                              Elaine Uehlein, parent council member at Anderson
                              School in Bozeman, Montana, discovered PledgeStar
                              two years ago and began using it to run the
                              school’s annual Fun Run.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              From the moment the event kicked off, the parent
                              council was thrilled with PledgeStar’s ease of
                              use—especially since their previous fundraiser, an
                              annual gala, was not only complicated to plan but
                              also time-consuming to manage. “There was less
                              handling of funds with PledgeStar,” says Ms.
                              Uehlein. “We wanted a single platform to handle
                              all of the financials, and that’s what we got with
                              PledgeStar. We were even able to manually handle
                              checks.”
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              Anderson School’s Fun Run also proved to be wildly
                              more lucrative by using PledgeStar when compared
                              to the school’s gala event. “We raised about
                              $50,000 both years we used PledgeStar,” Ms.
                              Uehlein explains, “while we were only raising
                              about $30,000 with the gala—which was also a lot
                              more work.”
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              Even the best event only succeeds when the
                              community participates, and Ms. Uehlein credits
                              PledgeStar’s communication element to the Fun
                              Run’s success: “With the ability to text and email
                              friends and family with PledgeStar, we felt like
                              we were getting a much bigger reach than just
                              sending home flyers like we did in the past,” she
                              says. Anderson School also motivated the students
                              to fundraise by offering amazing prizes for top
                              earners, which remained on display at school
                              throughout the fundraiser.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              “We worked really hard to find prizes that
                              appealed to all ages,” says Ms. Uehlein, who also
                              explains that some of the most sought-after prizes
                              didn’t cost the parent council a dime. “Community
                              members donated gift cards, and experiences such
                              as ‘principal for the day’ was a huge draw,” she
                              adds.
                            </p>
                            <p class="">
                              One prize got the kids more excited than any of
                              the others. “The class that earned the most money
                              got to pie our principal,” says Ms. Uehlein.
                            </p>

                              Anderson School is not only thrilled with the
                              success of the Fun Run but also what the funds
                              will provide to the small, 200-student school. “We
                              have a lot of needs,” explains Ms. Uehlein. “Now,
                              with these funds raised through PledgeStar, we are
                              able to really help with purchasing curriculum,
                              the music program, teacher classroom stipends,
                              teacher holiday gifts, and guest speakers. We will
                              also be able to maintain a healthy base for our
                              budget in the coming years.”

                              school with almost 1,000 students, switched to
                              PledgeStar this year to manage their Great Grizzly
                              Run. “Boosterthon kept almost 50%, so we wanted to
                              try and do it ourselves so we could keep more of
                              what we raised,” says Belinda Wise, Gilchrist PTO
                              event chair. “Another school in our district,
                              DeSoto Trail Elementary, recommended PledgeStar
                              and even helped us with the event. Our goal was to
                              raise $85,000, and we ended up with about
                              $95,000.”

                              In addition to its minimal learning curve, Ms.
                              Wise says she appreciated the straightforward
                              nature of PledgeStar’s website. “We really liked
                              that staff and parents could see the leaderboard,
                              how much we were raising and keeping, why we were
                              fundraising, and what prizes the kids could win,”
                              she says. “It was easy for our school’s families
                              to set up their own accounts, and we loved having
                              everyone on the same page.”

                              Making changes can be challenging, but any
                              concerns from Gilchrist administration about
                              switching platforms were alleviated once the PTO
                              thoroughly explained the benefits of partnering
                              with PledgeStar. “After our initial presentation,
                              the PTO and teachers were on board with switching
                              to PledgeStar, but the principal was worried
                              because this is our biggest fundraiser of the year
                              and we really count on the money raised,” Ms. Wise
                              shares. “Once we concluded the fundraiser with 20
                              percent more than we’d raised in previous years,
                              those fears were cast aside and the board voted
                              unanimously to continue using PledgeStar next
                              year.”

                              In addition to its financial windfall, the Great
                              Grizzly Run was an emotional success for Gilchrist
                              students. After two weeks of fundraising via
                              emails and texts sent through the PledgeStar
                              website, the school concluded the program with the
                              run itself–along with some very special guests.
                              “Florida State University cheerleaders and
                              softball players came to cheer on the kids while
                              they ran, which they loved,” says Ms. Wise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Students are typically motivated by rewards, but
                              Gilchrist decided to prioritize putting money back
                              into the school over purchasing expensive prizes.
                              “The kids got to wear Crocs and socks to school
                              when they hit a certain goal, and a PE coach
                              shaved a paw print into his hair when they reached
                              another,” says Ms. Wise. “But by far the highlight
                              for the students was when our principal got slimed
                              at the end of the fundraiser.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The additional money raised by partnering with
                              PledgeStar allowed Gilchrist Elementary to fund
                              the majority of the school’s needs, rather than
                              having to pick and choose. “We took 20 percent of
                              what we raised and gave every teacher money for
                              their classrooms,” says Ms. Wise. “We also used
                              some of it for campus improvements on outdoor
                              spaces that the staff requested such as fans for
                              the carpool pickup area and picnic tables and
                              benches throughout campus.”

                              In addition to the financial rewards of the
                              partnership, what really set PledgeStar apart from
                              other platforms for Gilchrist was the customer
                              service. “Several times, my questions were
                              answered immediately,” says Ms. Wise. “PledgeStar
                              even reached out to one of our teachers directly
                              to answer a question that I couldn’t.”

                              Gilchrist Elementary School is already sharing its
                              positive experience with PledgeStar throughout the
                              community. “We’ve recommended PledgeStar to
                              another school in the area that was seeking a new
                              fundraising platform,” Ms. Wise says. “It truly
                              met all of our needs.”

                              After seven years using the same fundraising
                              platform, the San Mateo-Foster City School
                              District Education Foundation made the switch to
                              PledgeStar. "We needed a platform with more
                              reporting features for our annual Read-a-Thon,”
                              says Elizabeth Colglazier, one of the foundation’s
                              directors. “With other fundraisers it was
                              difficult to report each school site’s progress.
                              We wanted to be able to view each school’s reading
                              minutes and money raised during and after the
                              event, and that’s exactly what we got with
                              PledgeStar."

                              Ms. Colglazier discovered PledgeStar by
                              researching what other education foundations in
                              the Bay Area were using for their read-a-thons and
                              asking for feedback from various directors. One of
                              those groups shared their success with PledgeStar
                              and switching platforms made sense. “It was a
                              great experience using PledgeStar for our annual
                              fundraiser,” she says. “Our matching donations
                              went up dramatically from previous years because
                              PledgeStar makes it so easy, and we even had more
                              people opting to cover the credit card fees than
                              when we used a competing fundraising company.”

                              The San Mateo-Foster City School District serves
                              10,000 students–three middle schools and 18
                              elementary schools—so organized reporting is vital
                              to a successful event. “The reports available on
                              PledgeStar were very user-friendly and very easy
                              to organize by classroom, teacher, and school
                              site,” Ms. Colglazier says. “We didn’t have that
                              capability on the platform we’d used in the past.
                              PledgeStar made it much easier for us to expand
                              our rewards system so that we could reward the top
                              classroom at each school site and top schools,
                              which we’d never been able to do before. This
                              capability helped make it a friendly competition
                              between the schools.”

                              Each year, local libraries host kickoff events to
                              get SMFC students excited about the Read-a-Thon
                              and promote the event. “Students spend the next
                              two weeks sending out donor requests and tracking
                              reading minutes,” Ms. Colglazier explains. “Each
                              school site’s principal and parent representative
                              advertise the event as well. We discovered that
                              schools that do more promotion are generally more
                              successful with the fundraiser, which included the
                              reminder emails from PledgeStar.”

                              For the duration of the Read-a-Thon, Ms.
                              Colglazier sent out daily reports of the top three
                              classrooms at each school, as well as the school
                              site with the highest average reading minutes and
                              percent participation. “The ability to easily run
                              and provide reports to each of our school sites
                              was vital to keeping the momentum of the
                              fundraiser,” Ms. Colglazier says. “There is not a
                              fee with 99Pledges, but we had to create these
                              reports by hand in years past, which could take
                              30-40 hours per week. This feature is exactly why
                              we switched to PledgeStar.”

                              The school with the highest average reading
                              minutes had an assembly with a local author who
                              read to the younger students and discussed the
                              publishing process with the older students. After
                              all was said and done, the students read for a
                              collective 1.9 million minutes over the course of
                              the fundraiser.

                              Ms. Colglazier says she would recommend PledgeStar
                              to any school putting on any type of “thon” event.
                              “It was really easy for students and families to
                              send out donor requests through email, text, and
                              social media,” she says. “Some even opted to print
                              fliers, which was a great option for those who
                              were not comfortable with using electronic
                              communication.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              In addition to the vital reporting features,
                              PledgeStar’s customer service team was a huge
                              asset to Ms. Colglazier. “They were great to work
                              with,” she says. “They were really responsive and
                              even made some changes to the platform to
                              accommodate our large district, which I really
                              appreciated.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Once the foundation receives all of its matching
                              dollars, they’ll have raised nearly $120,000. “We
                              were pleased with that number, as many of our
                              families have been hit with job layoffs in the
                              tech industry,” says Ms. Colglazier, whose
                              foundation is based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
                              “The funds we raised will go to important programs
                              like music and STEAM education, as well as staff
                              and student support. We couldn’t have done it
                              without the support of our amazing community and
                              the help of PledgeStar.”

                              Walk-a-Thon Chair Adrienne Virgilio knew that St.
                              Francis de Sales School in Lake Zurick, Illinois,
                              was in desperate need of an outstanding
                              fundraiser. She never imagined that partnering
                              with PledgeStar would see a profit of more than 10
                              times her original goal.
